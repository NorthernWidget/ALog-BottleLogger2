SWITCHES:
=========

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SW1    MAN-LOG and BT enable
-----------------------------
SW1    Short Press        - Initiates a manual reading of inputs and stores to SD-CARD
       Long press > 5s    - Switches BT module on while SW1 is closed. USed to remote manage logger from
                            BT enabled mobile device or PC
                            (Don't forget to disable the INT2 interrupt in this mode as it is not needed
                             while running in BT mode)
       Remove short       - Turn off BT module and return to automatic logging mode

SW2    RESET CPU          - Complete system restart and if DTR initiated restart to enter bootloader


INTS NOTES:
===================

INT0 is shared with USART1 and the RTC ALARM. In sleep mode the RTC has control (3.3V = 0). In active mode
the RTC ALARM is disconnected and the pin used as a USART1 RX input.

INT1 - Not available due to pinout. It is shared with USART1 TXD.

INT2 - External interrupt for user


LOGGER SLEEPING           -    RTC wakeup or external event via INT0 (Check DS3231 0xF Alarm register
                               bit A1F or A2F if INT was caused by RTC)

LOGGER SLEEPING and SW1=0 -    PINCHANGE INT to wake up CPU. Short press of button initates MANLOG as before.
                               Long press of SW1 (>5s) wakes up CPU and switches on Bluetooth module on USART0
                               to remotely manage logger and upload optionally data from SD card. (Intent is
                               to avoid having to open the logger enclosure. )
